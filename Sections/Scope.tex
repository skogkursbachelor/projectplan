\subsection{Delimitation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The product will primarily focus on mapping Gjøvik and its surrounding areas, as including larger regions would result in an excessive amount of data.
    \item The weight of vehicles using the roads will not be factored in when determining trafficability.
    \item The trafficability forecast for forest roads will extend up to a maximum of two weeks, as the product owner does not require a longer time frame.
    \item All software will be deployed on NTNU-hosted servers.
\end{itemize}
