\section{Goals \& Constraints}

\subsection{Background}
Skogkurs is a non-governmental organization established in 1958. The institute operates as a partnership, with 36 forestry organizations and scientific institutions as its members. Its activities are nationwide and encompass a wide range of topics, including forest management, construction and maintenance of forest roads, and forest operations and techniques \cite{skogkurs_eng}. Through its initiatives, Skogkurs aims to enhance the competence of professionals within the forestry industry and to promote knowledge of forests and nature to schools and the general public \cite{skogkurs_nor}. 

The Nordic forestry industry faces increasing challenges in ensuring stable timber transport throughout the year. Changes in climate have extended the snow-free season, creating variability in forest road conditions due to shifts between frozen, dry, and rainy periods. Addressing these challenges requires digital tools that can assess which forest roads are accessible during different weather conditions.

Recent research has focused on developing methodologies for digitally classifying forest road load-bearing capacities based on soil types and weather conditions. For example, a nationwide pilot study demonstrated that soil types, such as well-drained materials like glacial deposits, are more suitable for year-round use, while finer sediments require specific conditions like freezing or drying. These findings support the potential for fully digital solutions to predict road accessibility based on a combination of weather patterns and road construction characteristics. For more details see [\hyperref[appendix:thesis_assignment]{Appendix \ref*{appendix:thesis_assignment}}].

    Additionally, tools like HarvesterSeasons.com, developed by the Finnish Meteorological Institute, provide weekly forecasts of road conditions based on soil moisture, temperature, and snow depth. These forecasts use data from sources like NASA's SMAP and ESA's Sentinel-1 satellites to generate relative load-bearing predictions for winter and snow-free seasons. Such advancements aim to increase efficiency and reduce risks in forest operations under variable weather conditions [\ref{appendix:thesis_proposal}.

\subsection{Project Goals}
This section outlines the project's goals, which include product, impact, and learning goals.
\subsubsection{Product Goals}
% produkt som gj√∏r ...
The primary goal of the project is to develop and test a prototype system for fully digital modeling of forest road load-bearing capacity under varying conditions throughout the year. The solution will incorporate various geological and meteorological parameters, such as soil type and moisture, weather forecasts, and precipitation data, to generate an accurate classification of forest roads. This classification will be presented through an interactive map-based website. The roads will be color-coded using a traffic-light system, where green indicates safe roads, yellow signals caution, and red highlights unsafe roads. The system will provide users with a forecast for road conditions at least a week into the future, enabling better planning and decision-making. Furthermore, the system will prioritize ease of use, with an intuitive interface designed for transport managers, allowing them to make informed route choices based on real-time data and forecasts. 

\subsubsection{Impact Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced uncertainty for transport managers when setting the routes using forest roads.
