\section{Goals \& Constraints}
\subsection{Background}
Skogkurs is a non-governmental organization established in 1958. The institute operates as a partnership, with 36 forestry organizations and scientific institutions as its members. Its activities are nationwide and encompass a wide range of topics, including forest management, construction and maintenance of forest roads, and forest operations and techniques \cite{skogkurs_eng}. Through its initiatives, Skogkurs aims to enhance the competence of professionals within the forestry industry and to promote knowledge of forests and nature to schools and the general public \cite{skogkurs_nor}.

\subsection{Project Goals}
This section outlines the project's goals, which include product, impact, and learning goals.
\subsubsection{Product Goals}
% produkt som gj√∏r ...
The primary goal of the project is to develop and test a prototype system for fully digital modeling of forest road load-bearing capacity under varying conditions throughout the year. The solution will incorporate various geological and meteorological parameters, such as soil type and moisture, weather forecasts, and precipitation data, to generate an accurate classification of forest roads. This classification will be presented through an interactive, map-based website for easy accessibility. The roads will be color-coded using a traffic-light system, where green indicates safe roads, yellow signals caution, and red highlights unsafe roads. The system will provide users with a forecast for road conditions at least a week into the future, enabling better planning and decision-making. Furthermore, the system will prioritize ease of use, with an intuitive interface designed for transport managers, allowing them to make informed route choices based on real-time data and forecasts. 

\subsubsection{Impact Goals}
% Increased efficiency for all users
% konsekvens av produktet
% Reduced uncertainty
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced uncertainty for transport managers when setting the routes using forest roads.
    \item To validate the product's feasibility and effectiveness by conducting tests with end-users, such as transport managers, to assess its performance and usability in real-world scenarios.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learning Goals}
% Map APIs / Working with Map Data
% More advanced APIs (?)
% Caching for REST APIs (?)
% Getting experience working with real companies, real products, etc.
% Terraform OpenStack
% More experience with Docker
% SDLC experience (SCRUM / agile methodology)
% Using professional workflow tools (?)
% Testing for specific features (?)
% Foresting and/or other fields (?)
% Planning full project self (finding req-spec., etc.)
% User testing (?)
% Concurrency
