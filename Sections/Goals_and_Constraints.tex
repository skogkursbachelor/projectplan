\section{Goals \& Constraints}
\subsection{Background}
Skogkurs is a non-governmental organization established in 1958. The institute operates as a partnership, with 36 forestry organizations and scientific institutions as its members. Its activities are nationwide and encompass a wide range of topics, including forest management, construction and maintenance of forest roads, and forest operations and techniques. Through its initiatives, Skogkurs aims to enhance the competence of professionals within the forestry industry and to promote knowledge of forests and nature to schools and the general public \cite{skogkurs}.
