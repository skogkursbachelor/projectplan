\section{Planning, Follow-up, \& Reporting}

\subsection{Selection of SDLC model}

For this project, the team needed to select an appropriate system development life cycle (SDLC) model. Key factors considered in this decision included the clarity and flexibility of the requirements, team size, project timeline, product delivery goals, and prior experience \cite{sdlc_model}. 

The requirements provided by the Product Owner are intentionally ambiguous and flexible, allowing the team to prioritize the few fixed requirements upfront while iteratively refining the flexible ones over time. The team is composed of two members with similar experience levels, enabling close collaboration and effective decision-making. With a short project timeline of four months, a structure of 2-week sprints aligns perfectly with Scrum's iterative and adaptive approach, ensuring steady progress and regular opportunities for feedback. 

Since our project lacks clearly defined requirements and requires ongoing collaboration with the Product Owner, Scrum was the best fit for our team and project. Traditional methodologies like Waterfall were not suitable, as they rely on fixed requirements and a linear development process, which would limit our flexibility. Extreme Programming (XP), while valuable for high-collaboration environments with strict engineering practices like pair programming and test-driven development, was not fully suitable as our project does not emphasize these practices to the same extent \cite{extreme_programming}. Similarly, Lean development focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency but is less structured in terms of iterative planning, which we need to manage evolving requirements effectively \cite{lean_programming}. By adopting Scrum, we can iteratively refine requirements and adapt to changes throughout development \cite{sdlc_model}. To implement Scrum effectively, several key practices will be integrated into our workflow \cite{scrum_guide}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sprint Meetings:} The project will be divided into 2-week sprints. At the start of each sprint, sprint meetings will include sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives. During the planning phase, the team will select tasks from the product backlog to form the sprint backlog for the upcoming sprint. The review phase will focus on assessing progress and determining whether adjustments to the product backlog are needed. The retrospective phase will identify areas for improvement in the Scrum process itself.
    \item \textbf{Daily Scrum Meetings:} Short daily meetings will be conducted to discuss the progress of ongoing tasks, identify potential obstacles, and ensure alignment between team members.
    \item \textbf{Scrum Master:} Given that the team consists of only two members, we have decided to share the role of Scrum Master. Both members are responsible for ensuring adherence to the Scrum framework and continuously working to improve team efficiency. This collaborative approach allows us to maintain flexibility while upholding Scrum principles throughout the project.
    \item \textbf{Kanban:} To complement Scrum and further enhance workflow visibility, the team will utilize a Kanban board to track and manage tasks on GitHub. The Kanban board will consist of columns representing different stages of the workflow, such as Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done, and Discarded.
\end{itemize}
